Lyon College Hub

A responsive, accessible, multi-page web application that brings together events, dining information, and campus resources for students and visitors at Lyon College. The site demonstrates modern front-end development practices, API integration, and clean UI/UX design using Bootstrap and custom JavaScript.

- Project Overview

Lyon College Hub centralizes important campus information in a single, easy-to-navigate website.
This project was built for a web development final assignment and demonstrates:

Semantic HTML

Bootstrap 5 responsive layouts

Custom CSS

Interactive JavaScript

API-powered dynamic content (placeholder APIs)

Accessibility-first design

Clean deployment workflow via GitHub Pages

📄 Pages Included

Hero section with call-to-action buttons

Quick Links (Events, Dining, Map)

API-fed “Campus Highlights” section

Placeholder hero image

Global navigation and footer

2. Events (events.html)

Calendar placeholder UI

“Upcoming Events” populated from simulated API

Event cards with RSVP and View buttons

3. Dining (dining.html)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend

HTML5
